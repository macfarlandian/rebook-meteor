###Too lazy for a real README. 

Rebook a web-first platform for reading and writing immersive, dynamic books.

It began, like so many ideas, with a simple complaint: ebooks are garbage.

After several weeks of discussion and idea generation, our team at the UC Berkeley School of Information arrived at the question that formed our mission:

"What would ebooks look like if we started from scratch?"

We adopted three guiding principles for our design experiments.

A Book is an API: Ebooks are retrofit with the creaky design metaphors of print books and distributed in inert bundles with overly restrictive DRM. We wanted to try a radically different approach. A web-first book isn't a file you download; it's an API you can tap into and build on top of.

Exploration and Choice: The medium affords opportunities not only for creative use of language but also for creative deployment and manipulation of the mechanisms used to deliver them. We're enabling ebooks with flexible interfaces that support nontraditional modes of storytelling and nonlinear narratives.

Readers and Writers First: Itâ€™s not about the publishers, but the writers and the readers. What's missing from their ebook experience? How can we prevent them from being locked into proprietary platforms? What sorts of tools could help writers create rich, immersive digital stories at scale?
